			<h1> Nintendo - Timeline (Home consoles) </h1>
		</div>
		<div class="Div1">
			<div class="Div2">
				<p>
					The Japanese multinational consumer electronics company Nintendo has developed seven home 
					video game consoles and multiple portable consoles for use with external media, as well as 
					dedicated consoles and other hardware for their consoles. 
					As of September 30, 2021, in addition to Nintendo Switch, Nintendo has sold over 863.07 million hardware units.
					<br><br>
					The company's first console, the Color TV Game, was a success in Japan but was never released outside of Japan. Their first systems to achieve worldwide success were the Game & Watch handheld series, before achieving greater worldwide success with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), originally released as the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan in 1983. The NES restarted the video game industry after the video game crash of 1983, and was an international success.
					In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) was a strong seller, the Sega Genesis was a very strong contender.
					Nintendo and Sega would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation became the most popular console, beating the Nintendo 64, though Nintendo managed to sell more than Sega Saturn.
					<br><br>
					The Dreamcast, released in 1999, PlayStation 2, released in 2000, and Microsoft's Xbox, released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the GameCube. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance models.
					Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen (DS) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the Wii); they became some of the best-selling consoles of all time.
					In 2011, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with stereoscopic 3D capabilities, with the 3DS, which had very strong sales from the beginning. The Wii U, released in November 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted. The company's most recent console, Nintendo Switch, was released in March 2017 and has now surpassed the entire lifetime sales of the Wii U several times.

					<p>
						Released July 15, 1983, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit video game 
						console released by Nintendo in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and 
						Africa and was Nintendo's first home video game console released outside Japan. In Japan, 
						it is known as the "Family Computer" (or "Famicom", as it is commonly abbreviated). 
						<br><br>
						Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry 
						following the video game crash of 1983 and set the standard for subsequent consoles in 
						everything from game design to business practices. The NES was the first console for which 
						the manufacturer openly courted third-party developers. Many of Nintendo's most iconic 
						franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES.

				<p>
					Released November 21, 1990, The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, officially abbreviated 
					the Super NES or SNES and colloquially shortened to Super Nintendo, is a 16-bit video game 
					console released by Nintendo in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and 
					Africa. In Japan it is known as the Super Famicom. In South Korea, it is known as the Super 
					Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.
					<br><br>
					The SNES was Nintendo's third home console(second outside of Japan), following the Nintendo 
					Entertainment System. Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large 
					parts of Asia, the SNES was a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's 
					popularity in Northeast Asia and North America—due in part to increased competition from Sega's 
					Genesis console. Despite its relatively late start, the SNES became the best selling console of 
					the 16-bit era, selling 49.10 million systems worldwide.

			<h3> Nintendo GameCube (2001) </h3>

		<div class="Div1">
			<div class="Div2">
				<p>
					The Nintendo GameCube (commonly shortened to GameCube, NGC, or GCN) was released on November 5, 
					2001. It was Nintendo's sixth generation game console, the same generation as Sega's Dreamcast, 
					Sony's PlayStation 2, and Microsoft's Xbox. Until the console's unveiling at SpaceWorld 2000, the 
					design project was known as Dolphin—this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' 
					model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. 
					<br><br>
					The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use optical discs rather than game cartridges. 
					An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer Matsushita led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the 
					Panasonic Q, which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on 
					sequels to their established hit franchises such as Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros. 
					Melee, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, Pokémon Colosseum, and Star Fox Adventures, 
					while new franchises like Animal Crossing and Pikmin were born, although the former franchise had 
					seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64. The GameCube has sold 21.74 million units.

			<h3> Wii (2006) </h3>
		</div>
		<div class="Div1">
			<div class="Div2">
				<p>
					The Wii was released on November 19, 2006 as Nintendo's seventh-generation home console. Nintendo 
					designed the console to appeal towards a wider audience than those of its main competitors, the 
					PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, including "casual" players and audiences that were new to video games.
					These aims were emphasized by the console's distinguishing feature, the Wii Remote—a handheld 
					motion controller that can detect motion and rotation in three dimensions, using a mixture of 
					internal sensors and infrared positioning. 
					<br><br>
					The controller includes an expansion port that can be 
					used to connect other accessories, such as the Nunchuk—an attachment with an analog stick and 
					additional buttons, a "Classic Controller" gamepad providing a traditional control scheme, and 
					Wii MotionPlus—an accessory designed to enhance the motion detection capabilities of the original 
					Wii Remote models.
					<br><br>
					The Wii was a major success for Nintendo; in April 2007, the Wall Street Journal declared that 
					Nintendo had "become the company to beat in the games business", citing the success of the Wii 
					and the portable Nintendo DS line.
					<br><br>
					The Wii U was released on November 18, 2012 as a direct successor to the Wii, and the first entry in the eighth generation of home video game consoles. The Wii U's distinguishing hardware feature is the GamePad, a tablet-like controller which contains a touchscreen that wirelessly streams a video output from the console.
					The Wii U was met with low adoption, attributed by Nintendo executives with lack of third-party support, poor marketing of the system, which led to a lack of clarity of the Wii U game pad from being a tablet device, as well as the subsequent release of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the following year.
